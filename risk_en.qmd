# Union & political activities in the workplace

Check out [this document CAPE has prepared regarding your rights and risks while taking part in union activity at work.](https://www.acep-cape.ca/sites/default/files/2024-08/Union%20Activity%20at%20Work_EN.pdf)

Our employer has a material interest in limiting what we do in this fight for telework rights. <u>**It is in the employer's best interest to spread misinformation, in order to frighten us into inaction.**</u> Some departments are already reporting that senior management has been telling staff that signing petitions or wearing buttons is a breach of the values and ethics code. That is false. Unfortunately we should expect to see similar misinformation spread here.

Remember, <u>**don't take risks without strategic reason!**</u> While the situation can be frustrating at times, keep a cool head and stick to the plan and let's fight this together!

## General Guidelines

Public Servants have a chartered right to freedom of speech. However, this is considered in balance with two duties that public servants are bound by:

* Loyalty to their employer (Government of Canada)
* Impartiality to the public at large (and the appearance of impartiality)

Expressing ideas that are not in alignment with government policy can in some circumstances be considered to breach these duties. To evaluate and mitigate your risk in taking action, ask yourself the following questions:

* [Who is seeing the message?](#who-is-seeing-the-message)
* [How is the message framed?](#how-is-the-message-framed)
* [What is the medium of the message?](#what-is-the-medium-of-the-message)
* [Who is sending the message?](#who-is-sending-the-message)


### Who is seeing the message?

Public servants have more leeway in expressing their opinions around colleagues in the public service as opposed to expressing opinions to third party contractors, external clients or the public at large. This is why we recommend taking off campaign buttons, and not using campaign video backgrounds when speaking with external clients or the public. This is also a good reason to avoid social media posts, speaking with the media, or speaking at rallies.

### How is the message framed?

Frame your messaging in support of something as opposed to criticising government policy. Some examples of messages in support of telework are:

- Teleworking works!
- Telework is a costless way for the employer to meet their ‘duty to accommodate’ the needs of many employees.
- Telework allows us to have a more diverse workforce.


### What is the medium of the message?

Using the employer’s systems, assets and tools is higher risk. This would include: 

- Putting up posters in the office
- Using your out of office auto-reply message
- Using work email & MS teams to communicate
- Using MS teams video backgrounds

This is both because they have some right to dictate how you use their tools, and because they can see your messaging. 

We recommend you not discuss this campaign using work email, and that if you use Teams messages you keep the messages simple (ex. “can we meet to chat about RTO on your next break?”). For information on risk mitigation when using MS teams backgrounds see [backgrounds](#backgrounds).

### Who is sending the message?

Your role in the public service affects how your actions affect public perceptions of impartiality. You may be at higher risk if you:

* Are very visible publicly
* Have more authority in your role at work
* Are in a role that is tied to the topic (ie. your role is directly tied to implementation of RTO)

## Risk mitigation by action

### Petition 

You have a right to sign petitions and share information about the union’s campaigns during non-working time (such as during lunch hour and breaks).

Signing the petition is one of the safest ways you can take part and here is why:

This is a majority petition, that means we will not be delivering the petition until a majority have signed it. 

<u>For CAPE members:</u>

We will not deliver your signatures until after we either have signatures from the majority of StatCan CAPE members, or signatures from the majority of union members at statcan under the following unions (CAPE, PIPSC, PSAC, & ACFO)

<u>For PIPSC, PSAC & ACFO members:</u>

While this petition is being managed by CAPE, the decision as to when to deliver the signatures from PIPSC, PSAC & ACFO members will be up to those who are coordinating from those unions. We will update this page with details soon.

### Spreading the word

You have the right to discuss and share information about the union’s campaigns during non-working time (such as during lunch hour and breaks).

To lower your risk, limit the amount you discuss union campaigns in writing through employer tools (Teams and work email) and especially avoid discussing in group chats. Be sure you keep these conversations to non-working time (such as during lunch hour and breaks). Ideally save longer conversations about union campaigns for when you can discuss verbally (including an MS Teams call), or through non-work channels. You can use MS Teams or work email to ask your coworkers if they would be available to chat or call on their next break/lunch to set up these conversations.

### Backgrounds 

Please consider the following ways to limit your risk while using a Teams background to show your support:

1. If management asks you to take the background down, do so! 
If this happens we encourage you to follow up with an email asking for an explanation of why you you were asked to take it down and clarification as to the limitations on what you can use as a Teams background going forward and share the responses with us at [RTO.LOC.503@gmail.com](mailto:RTO.LOC.503@gmail.com)
1. Do not use these backgrounds for meetings with external clients.
1. Coordinate with others in your unit and division. It will make a bigger impact if many of you start using the backgrounds at the same time, and acting together lowers your individual risk.
1. If you're asked to take the 'RemoteWorks' background down, or just want a less risky way to take part, consider using the [generic green background](bkgrd_en.qmd#generic-green-background). Green is the colour the unions have agreed on for the telework rights fight. Imagine the visual impact of a division wide meeting where 70% of people have a solid green background.

### Attending Rallies

Attending a rally is a very low risk action. Your risk increases if:

* You’re carrying a sign, how much additional risk depends on the content of the sign
* You give a speech
* You speak to the media (please don't speak to the media. All union organized rallies should have have a designated media spokesperson who will handle any media questions)
